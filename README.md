# cGcC
A simple python3 implementation of cGcC score algorithm.
cGcC is an algorithm proposed by Jean-Denis Beaudoin et al in 2013 that can be used to characterized the formation capabilities of RNA G-quadruplexes.

The script can be easily executed under the python3 environment (python3.6 is recommended, for that other python versions are not tested).
